n= Population site.
tfinal= max time for which the simulation is run.
trig= time at which dominance is allowed to evolve.
eco= time at which gain curve parameters switch from zero to one (see below).
a0= initial promoter affinity and locus contribution (equal for all).
f0= max female fecundity
gamma_f0= female gain curve exponent BEFORE ecological switch
gamma_f1= female gain curve exponent AFTER ecological switch
m0= max male fecundity
gamma_m0= male gain curve exponent BEFORE ecological switch
gamma_m1= male gain curve exponent AFTER ecological switch
nloc= number of loci
u= mutation rate for allelic effects and loci contributions
uprom= mutation rate for promoters (dominance)
sig= standard deviation of the normal distribution for mutation effects
tmes= number of generations between two measurements
nmes= number of individuals measured
n_it= number of interations
